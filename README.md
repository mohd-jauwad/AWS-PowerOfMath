Here we will be using 5 AWS Service shown below to build an end to end web application. 

<Services we'll be using>

<what do we need >

Firstly, let us create/host a webpage

AWS Amplify : AWS Amplify is a development framework provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the process of building scalable and secure web and mobile applications. 

Here we will use amplify to deplu and host our webpage 

1. Download the index.html file and zip it
2. Drag and Drop the Zip in AWS Ampligy

AWS AMplify >> New app >> Host web app >> Deploy without Git proivder >> drag and drop the zip file >> done

Weve now succesfully created and hosted the webpage! 

Now we need to do some math. Enter Lambda.
To do this, we'll use a lambda function i.e codes runs upon some trigger 
its just code or fucntions sitting out there that get run when you need them, there are also serverless! 

AWS Lambda : AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). In simple terms, it allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. 

AWS lambda >> Create funciton >> Aurthor from scratch >> Python >> create function
